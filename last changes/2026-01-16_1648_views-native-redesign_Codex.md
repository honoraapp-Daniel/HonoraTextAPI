Change title: Apply native-style redesign to remaining views
Intent: Align remaining views with the clean, native iOS look used elsewhere, without touching logic.
Method: Updated layout, typography, colors, and card styling in BrowserViews, NotesListView, NoteDetailView, ProfileView, and SectionsView using system components/colors.
Reason: User requested the same new design across all views (excluding TagPickerSheet and SaveToNoteSheet).
Files touched: Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/BrowserViews.swift; Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/NotesListView.swift; Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/NoteDetailView.swift; Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/ProfileView.swift; Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/SectionsView.swift
Tests: Not run (UI-only changes).
