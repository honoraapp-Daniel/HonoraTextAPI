# Change title
AGENTS guide for Honora Book API

## Intent
Provide shared operating instructions for agents working on Honora Book API to reduce misalignment.

## Method
Created AGENTS.md in repo root summarizing product scope, stack, status, do-not-touch areas, workflow rules, snapshot template, walkthrough protocol, testing and git discipline. Added this log in last changes/.

## Reason
We need a single source of truth to read before tasks so both agents follow the same process and constraints.

## Files touched
- AGENTS.md
- last changes/2025-12-29_1621_agents-guide_Codex.md

## Tests
Not run (documentation-only change).

## Agent signature
Codex
