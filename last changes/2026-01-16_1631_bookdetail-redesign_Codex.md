Change title: Simplify BookDetailView styling
Intent: Align BookDetailView with the clean, native iOS look used for the home view and mini player.
Method: Reworked header, actions, and content rows to system fonts/colors, simplified layout and progress styling, and removed gradient-heavy styling.
Reason: User requested the same minimal UI treatment applied across the app.
Files touched: Honora Data Test/Honora Data Test/Views/BookDetailView.swift
Tests: Not run (UI-only changes).
